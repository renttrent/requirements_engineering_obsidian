Goal-oriented Requirements Engineering

focuses on activities that **precede** the formulation of system-level requirements

**aims** to answer the question why a system is needed in the first place

**agents** are responsible for achieving goals, ex: humans, devices, software

a **requirement** is a sub-goal that a single software agent has to fulfil

an **assumption** is a goal delegated to a single agent in the environment
assumptions cannot be enforced by the system-to-be

goals can provide a criterion for completeness of a requirements specification

=> [[Goal Refinement]]
