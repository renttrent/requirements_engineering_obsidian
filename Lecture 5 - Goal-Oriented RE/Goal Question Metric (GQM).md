To objectively judge if a goal is satisfied, you need to measure. **But what shall we measure?**

- **Conceptual level (GOAL)**: A goal is defined for an object
- **Operational level (QUESTION)**: A set of questions tries to characterise the object of measurement (product, process, resource) with respect to a selected quality issue and to determine its quality from the selected viewpoint
- **Quantitative level (METRIC)**: Observable data is associated with every question in order to answer it in a quantitative way. Metrics can be objective or subjective.
