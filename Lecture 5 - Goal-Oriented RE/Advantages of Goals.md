or Goal Models

- Achieve completeness: a requirements specification is **sufficiently complete**, if we can show that all the goals can be achieved from the specification and properties of the domain
- **Avoid irrelevant requirements**, every requirement is linked to a goal
- Justify the effort for fulfilling requirements to stakeholders by showing the link to their goals
- They allow us to resolve conflicts between conflicting requirements by making the conflict explicit
- Make it possible to design and implement excitement factors for the user or customer they did not think of initially
