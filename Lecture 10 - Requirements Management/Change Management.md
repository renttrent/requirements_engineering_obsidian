**Objectives of change management** for requirements:
- Systematic and controlled recording of change requests 
- Evaluation of change requests (sense and effort, risks etc.) 
- Decision on the implementation of the changes 
- Implementation of the changes 

**Important related tasks:**
- Impact analysis: What effects do changes have?
- Version management: Which versions of requirements and artifacts exist? 
- Configuration management: Which requirements or artifacts together form consistent states?
- Error management: How are errors recorded, classified, documented, diagnosed, corrections determined and implemented?


### Establishment of Change Management

- Define a **change process**
	- to **record proposed changes** (Change Requests, CRs)
	- and to **decide on their implementation**
	- and to **implement them**
- Create **responsibilities** and a **change control board**
	- in which all interest groups are represented
	- who is responsible for making decisions and monitoring the implementation of the changes
- Creation of a **change database** that supports the change process


### Establishment of Change Management & Changes in RE

A Change Request (CR) includes
- what exactly should be changed and
- why it should be changed 

For each CR: 
- perform an impact analysis to check which consequences/risks the change entails (with regard to affected artifacts). 
- evaluate the benefits of the change, as well as the time and budget required for CR. 
- to clarify who will bear the additional costs.
- implement the change and update the requirements documentation. 

â†’ Requirement artifacts should be updated, changes logged (Interaction with problem management )
