An appropriate Structuring and Attribution of requirements are essential requirements for RM.

Example: Attributes can represent the status of requirements, for example:

Requirements are approximate (in terms of the requirement life cycle): 
- Proposed / Edited / Agreed / Evaluated 
- Accepted / Reserved / Rejected 
- Validated 
- Implemented
- Prioritized 
- Changed / Replaced
- Verified

#### Status Model: Example from Quasar Requirements

#### Elementary Attributes: Priority and Acceptance Criterion

**Priority**: 
- Not always all requirements can be implemented and usually not all requirements are equally important
- → Prioritization of requirements, e.g., by means of Must/Could/Would ("MusCoW-Method") 
- → Depending on the procedure in RE and the priority − requirements are implemented in steps (increments) and deleted (e.g., for time boxing) 
**Acceptance Criterion**: 
- It is not always possible to clearly evaluate and check all requirements, or to decide during acceptance when the implementation of the requirement was appropriate from the perspective of the stakeholders 
- → Acceptance criterion defines criteria under which the implementation of the requirements is considered valid
