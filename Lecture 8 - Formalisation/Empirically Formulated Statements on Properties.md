[[Empirical studies]]

Statements about the properties of systems can also be formulated **empirically**
- Capturing the statements by observations of systems and their environment.
- Verification by experiments and measurements possible.
- Metrics!

Examples: 
- A system error occurs only once in 10 hours for a given operating situation. 
- With 10 entries from a certain sample 9 usable answers are generated.

#### Conclusion: Statements on Properties

**Formulation of Statements on Properties**:
- Subjective: No explicit model / description system
- Objective: Explicit model / description system
- Empirical: No mathematical prediction / explanatory model (observations / measurements)
- Formalised: Mathematical prediction / explanatory model
- Partially Combinable

**Connection**:
- Statement about property used as a requirement for a system to be built
- Formalised requirements and agility
