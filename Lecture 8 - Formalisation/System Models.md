What is a [[System Model]]?
What is a [[View]]?

System Models determine what requirements are talking about:
	What is a system
	What are the essential characteristics, views, structures
	Which components and structures does a system have

### Difference between System Models and Models of a System

| **System Model** (Meta Model)                                                   | Model of a System (Artifact Model)                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| its constructs are necessary to describe models                                 | ideally built on system models like content models                          |
| conceptual model using different viewpoints on a system                         | structuring of models in structure models                                   |
| modelled in two consistent views:<br>- class diagram<br>- sequence diagram etc. | artefact model like:<br>- BPMN<br>- State Chart Diagram<br>- Use Cases etc. |
### Examples for System Models

Wide range of system models and modelling languages available and used in practice:
- Software: Programming models like UML
- Embedded: Control engineering like MATLAB-Simulink models

**Example System Model**:
- There are **two view** types defined in a meta model like a sequence diagram and class diagram
- Each **actor** in the sequence diagram represents an **instance of a class** in a class diagram
- If a name of an actor (present as a class in the class diagram) is **missing** in the sequence diagram, then **inconsistency** is present in the model
- Syntactic inconsistency needs to be **avoided** with system models.
