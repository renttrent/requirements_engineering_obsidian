- A formal description language
	- A set of description language
	- Based on a specific system view

Implicit model building and is therefore
- an **abstraction**
- only as correct as observations of reality correspond to those on the model (validity of a model)

**Falsification of a model**: Through observation, contradictions between model and reality are detected.
