Different types of non-functional requirements for ML exist:
- Fairness
- Transparency / Explainability
- Privacy
- Security

Other qualities of ML models:
- **Correctness / Performance**: Metrics like Precision, Recall, Average Precision, Intersection over Union
- **Computational Efficiency, energy**: Is the model lightweight or do we need a GPU server to run inference?
- **Interpretability**: How does the model work? Why did the model come to that conclusion?
- **Robustness**: Is the model prone to attacks and does it work in new / unusual environments?
