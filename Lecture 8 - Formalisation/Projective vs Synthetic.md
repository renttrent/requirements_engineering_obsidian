**Projective** (God Model)
Holds all models for all views. God models get projected into requested views.
Consistency is given "for free"

**Synthetic** (Coupling of Models)
Different views or view types implemented with specific tools are pairwise coupled
worst case quadratic couplings

Is **the effort** (cost, maintenance, collaboration) **justifiable** for the benefits (higher quality) that **those models** promise?
- Probably not for software
- But probably for hardware
