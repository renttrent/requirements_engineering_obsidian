A (formal) [[Model]] is always an **abstraction** of reality
- Formalisation and modelling create an independent view of systems
- Formalisation only allows the formulation of certain properties that can be spoken about in the model

But:
Systems (even software) are ultimately part of our reality
- Note difference between model and reality (danger of detachment from reality)
- Always consider to what extent the model validly represents a property of the system
- Precision is sometimes unintentional and invalid
