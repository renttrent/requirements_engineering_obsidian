How can we show that a specific **functional requirement** is fulfilled?
- Test for performance metrics (90% accuracy)
- Test on the collected dataset might be problematic
- Need to avoid overfitting on training data with validation techniques (validation set, cross validation)

How can we show that a specific **non-functional requirement** is fulfilled?
- For instance, runtime performance in Deep Learning influenced by model size
- Training != Using
