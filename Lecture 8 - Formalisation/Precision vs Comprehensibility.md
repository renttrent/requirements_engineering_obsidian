### One Tradeoff: Precision vs Comprehensibility

**Precision** (Objective)
How precise are Requirements formulated
-> Requires Formalisation

**Comprehensibility** (Subjective)
How good and simple are requirements to understand
-> Depends on target group

**Caveat**:
- A very precisely formulated requirement can be **difficult to understand** (e.g if the formalism used is not familiar to the target group) A requirement can be misinterpreted or not understood
- A requirement that is (apparently) very understandable from an individual point of view can be **interpreted in different ways**.
	 it can be misinterpreted and thus **misunderstood**
