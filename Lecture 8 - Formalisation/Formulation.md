# Formulation of Statements

**Subjectivity**: Related to the communication partners ("subjects")
- Ability to formulate given statements precisely (for the producer) and to understand them (for the consumer)
**Objectivity**: Related to a description system
- Statements reduce subjectivity through methods of description (formalisation) that are independent of subjective judgements
- Attention: Objectivity leads to the problem of subjectivity by asking whether producers and consumers are capable of formulating and understanding in the description system
**Intersubjectivity**: An issue is equally recognisable and comprehensible for several viewers
- There is agreement on how to perceive the facts, how to classify them and what they mean
