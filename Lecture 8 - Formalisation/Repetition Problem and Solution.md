Machine Learning is the solution, not the problem

**Requirements for ML Systems are hard to specify:**
- Functional Requirement Example: "Detect all pedestrians in the image"
- If we could **formally** (rule based) **specify the output** of an **ML system**, why would we need a ML system in the first place? (one reason: performance!)
- What is the **contradiction** between the **usage of ML** and the demand of precise and unambiguous system requirements?
