**Definition Machine Learning (ML):**
Machine Learning (ML) generates outputs based on statistical correlations to training data. The input-output pairs of a ML System are thus not specifically programmed but learned through sample data.

Machine Learning:
- Used in different applications like comp vision, speech recognition, medical diagnosis
- Different ML algorithms exist such as SVM, Decision Trees, Linear Regression, Bayesian Networks, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Deep Learning
- Learning through optimization: Different training algorithms like evolutionary algorithms, gradient descent, information gain, expectation-maximization
