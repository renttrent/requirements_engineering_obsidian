A system is delimited from its environment (operational context) by *defining its system boundary*.

A system has an *interface* that defines which forms of interaction between a system and its environment are possible (static / syntactic interface) and which behaviour the system shows from the context view (interface behaviour, dynamic interface, interaction view)

A system has an **architecture**. The architecture consists of elements (components, subsystems) that are interrelated.
