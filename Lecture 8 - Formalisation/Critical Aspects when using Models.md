- Effort / Benefit when using models (e.g detailed scenarios for trivial issues, synchronisation)
- Complexity of models and choice of notation
- Analysis and documentation of scenarios is crucial:
	- Scenarios from a communication bridge between
		- Stakeholders (for analysis / coordination)
		- Architects (draft)
		- Testers (specification of test cases)
	- **Trade-Off**: The more precise / formal the modelling, the more targeted questions can be asked and handled by stakeholders - **but the more you (have to) define** 
		- explicit feedback to stakeholders, their goals and requirements
		- exposure of need for clarification, conflicts
		- vote, negotiate, prioritise and decide
