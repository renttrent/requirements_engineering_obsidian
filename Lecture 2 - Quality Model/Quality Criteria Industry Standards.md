IEEE Standard 830 - 1998

- **Consistency**: Consistency and thus feasibility
- **Completeness**: All relevant requirements are recorded
- **Correctness**: All recorded requirements represent valid, applicable wishes and specifications with stakeholders
- **Clarity**: Requirements are unambiguous
- **Verifiability**: Fulfilment of the requirements can be verified beyond any doubt, requirements are measurable if necessary
- **Modifiability**: Changes to the requirements can be made in a controlled manner
- **Traceability**: The implementation of the requirement can be traced
- **Prioritisation**: Requirements are ranked according to their importance
- **Comprehensibility**: Requirements are easy to understand
