Enables progress control, and guidelines for fulfilment.
A story is either done or not done. There is no intermediate state.
Every story has its own definition of done (Three C's. Card, Conversation, **Confirmation**)

Generic Requirements that apply to all user stories can be summarised in a general DoD.
Common Examples: Update documentation, tested with specific coverage criterium, UI texts added in both German and English, non-functional requirements, â€¦

If a non-functional requirement is no longer fulfilled, the story is not yet done!
