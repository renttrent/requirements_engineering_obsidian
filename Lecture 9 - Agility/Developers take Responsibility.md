In agile processes like Scrum, the developers are responsible for prioritization of requirements, selecting the sprint backlog items, and **commit to the product vision and the sprint goal.**

Conflicts between contrasting goals are resolved by discussion (at least in theory) 
### Empowerment of the developers leads to ethical responsibility! 

Everything is negotiable. No excuses such as “I didn't know what it will be used for”.
