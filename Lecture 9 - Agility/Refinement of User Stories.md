Sometimes called "grooming"

Elaborate on the details of a user story before it is added to the sprint backlog: 
- Why do we need it? What is the business value? 
- Should we split the story? 
- What are acceptance criteria for the story? 
- Considering the acceptance criteria, is the story technologically feasible?
- Effort estimation

Add the story to the Sprint Backlog or send it back to the Product Backlog
