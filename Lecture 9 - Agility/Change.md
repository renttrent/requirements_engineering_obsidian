User Stories are not set in stone, they are always **negotiable**.

**Incorporate user feedback**
This includes: Establishing a mechanism to collect and evaluate this feedback! The Product Owner is responsible to mirror the target group‘s feedback in the meetings.

**Accept imperfection**
Until the story is considered for the next sprint, accept to have a high-level, not perfectly detailed state for the time being.

**Backlog refinement**
Regularly adapt your requirements to change and new user needs.

#### Mitigating the negative effects of Change

**Change requires re-planning**: *Do not plan what you cannot plan in the first place*.
Sprint Planning: only plan in detail what you can achieve in the next sprint! During a sprint: the requirements that were agreed upon are fixed and ==must not== change. ⇒ *Choose the length of sprints according to the expected change!*

**Change requires the team to discuss everything again**: *No, the responsibility is pinned to one role only*. 
The product owner identifies the need for changes and adapts the backlog items accordingly. Already refined items in the sprint backlog are not changed.

**Change can make everything we already did obsolete**: *Yes, but* to save time, the PO has the authority to call an „abnormal sprint termination“, e.g. if a security patch is needed immediately, or the sprint goal is no longer valid.

**Change will lead to wrong decisions**: Must empirically manage the process, must set up a learning culture!
