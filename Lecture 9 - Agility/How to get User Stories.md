**Primary Source**: Customer/User and Product Owner!
(but sometimes there's no customer or user)

**Secondary Sources**:
- Find early (beta) users asap, e.g. offer special conditions
- Create your own user => Personas
- Sources of Requirements as discussed in previous lectures, e.g:
	- Design Thinking & Elicitation Techniques
	- Competitors, other Stakeholders, Workshops
	- Laws, Literature, Standards

### Managing User Stories

Scrum Board, Kanban Board, or similar.

**Sprint planning**
Whole team refines user stories and discusses prioritization and estimated effort. They select which user stories to implement in the sprint based on time and expected value.

#### Effort Estimation

**Planning Poker**
Secret Voting: Everyone chooses a card with a number describing the estimated effort. Only certain values are allowed.

Estimations are simultaneously revealed.

Subsequent discussion: Team members with lowest estimate explain reasons, then member with highest.

Main driver for agile processes is [[Change]].
