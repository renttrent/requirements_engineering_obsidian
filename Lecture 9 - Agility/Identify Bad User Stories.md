**Role-related:**
- Unspecific, faceless user: "As a user, I ..." Name the specific role! E.g. "frequent customer"
- Implementation detail without user value: "As a developer, I want to use Tensorflow 2.4.1"

**Goal-related**:
- Not separating problem and solution: "... I want a dropdown menu so that I can select an option"
- Goal repeating the function: "...,  I want to edit my details so that I can change them"
- Mixing goal and function: "... I want to log in, so that I can rent a scooter"

**Indicators that the story should be split**
- The word 'and': "As a ... I want to .. AND ..."
- If people start using the ID of the story instead of its title, story could be too complicated
