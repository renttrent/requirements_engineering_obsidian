The requirement candidates are not suitable for development without further processing because they are formulated from a very specific **stakeholder viewpoint**.

- Question why a requirement was raised 
- Abstract from demands that are too concrete (get back from the solution to the problem!)

Example: 
**Requirement candidate from customer:**
"In a window in the upper right-hand corner of the screen, the time must be displayed so that the time of receipt can be noted when an application is received".

**Possible motivation:**
Customer is influenced by previous solution and workflow.

**Possible requirement:**
"The time of receipt must be noted for each application".
