### LEARN | Error Analysis: 
List all things that could possibly go wrong when using the product and determine their causes. This is a good way to understand how to mitigate human errors or other failures

### ASK | Five Whys:
Ask „Why?“ in response to five consecutive answers. 
This forces people to examine and formulate the underlying reasons, hidden motivations and goals.

### LOOK | Fly on the Wall: 
Observe and record users in their context without interfering, to see what people actually do within the real contexts instead of relying on their statements.

### TRY | Paper prototyping: 
Sketch, layout, print / build a concept as early as possible using paper or cardboard. This is a good way to quickly organize, articulate and visualize your ideas.

**More examples:**
- Learn: Cross-cultural comparisons, Error Analysis, Long-range Forecasts, …
- Look: A Day in a Life, Fly on the wall, Still-Photo-Survey, Time-lapse video
- Ask: Card Sort, 5 Whys, Unfocus Group, Extreme User Interviews, … 
- Try: Bodystorming, Paper Prototyping, Role-Playing, Be your customer, …
