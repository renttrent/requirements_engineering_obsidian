The needs and requirements of the stakeholders need to be **elicited**.
The result of the elicitation is a **requirement candidate**.

#### Challenges:
- Finding the stakeholders
- Some stakeholders are not available for discussions (e.g. legislation, competing suppliers)
- Stakeholders are not able to express their expectation:
	 "Well, I don't know what I imagined, but certainly not that!"
- Stakeholders might know what they want, but not what they need:
	 "I want a Ferrari to go on safaris in the jungle."
- Hardly any separation of problem and solution:
	 "There should by a green button with a disk icon to save my progress, and a red X to dismiss my changes."

There are [[Need]]s, [[User Requirement]]s and [[System Requirement]]s
