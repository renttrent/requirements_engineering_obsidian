Finding requirements if there is no client

A large share of systems are developed for the market, meaning there is no client at the beginning of the project! This bears challenges not only for marketing but also for requirements engineering.

Some **requirement sources** are still available, e.g: business processes, literature, creativity techniques, laws, competitor products, â€¦

**But we need early and frequent user feedback for user-centric development!**

- Find test users as early as possible - perhaps by offering discounts and early delivery if they get involved in development
- Imagine potential customers and users ([[Personas]] and [[Target Groups]])!
