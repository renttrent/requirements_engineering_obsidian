**Brainstorming done right:**
1. Phase 1
	1. Let your imagination run free.
	2. Ideas are freely formulated without having to justify or defend them
	3. Taking up and developing ideas
	4. Producing as many ideas as possible in a short time 
	5. No criticism in Phase 1!
$$\text{short break between phases}$$
2. Phase 2
	1. Evaluate ideas
	2. Sort ideas
	3. Merge ideas
