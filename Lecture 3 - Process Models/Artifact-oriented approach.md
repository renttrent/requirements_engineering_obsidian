**Evaluation:**

| Advantages                                                                | Disadvantages                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Awareness of clear result structures (content, dependencies, terminology) | High learning curve (thinking in processes is habitual behavior) |
| Testable quality and progress control                                     | Definition & selection of adequate methods                       |
| Clear roles and responsibilities                                          | Derivation of plans complex                                      |
| Good adaptability                                                         |                                                                  |
Why artifact orientation in RE?


| Common problems in practice                                                            | Characteristics of artifact orientation                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Maintenance hard w/o solid requirements documentation (but also: write-only-documents) | Documentation                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Roles, responsibilities and skill profiles often unclear                               | Definition of responsibilities along the created artifacts                                                                                                                                       |
| Lack of understanding of content, context and terminology in the artifacts             | Implicit knowledge about (domain) content is explicitly recorded<br>- Modelling concepts and notations<br>- Contexts<br>- Awareness for consistent and complete results<br>- Integration into QA |
