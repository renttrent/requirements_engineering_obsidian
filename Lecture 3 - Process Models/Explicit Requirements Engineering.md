[[Requirements Engineering]] represents the **bridge from stakeholder goals into software development**.

- RE is a **decision-making** process:
	- Recognise, evaluate, decide.
	- RE is part of the decision whether a project should be carried out
- RE must always start with the **individual** project starting point
	- Are goals clear - is there agreement on them?
	- Are responsible persons RE-capable?
	- Is the application domain understood?

There cannot be one standardised process for all projects.

[[Essential aspects in explicit RE]]

In Requirements Engineering we must capture both [[Problem Space and Solutions Space]].
