**6.1 Requirement processes** 
The project shall implement the following requirements engineering processes as defined in ISO/IEC/ IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, depending on the adherence to one or both of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207. 
- Business or mission analysis process (ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015, 6.4.1 or ISO/IEC/ IEEE 12207:2017, 6.4.1).
- Stakeholder needs and requirements definition process (ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015, 6.4.2 or ISO/ IEC/IEEE 12207:2017, 6.4.2)
- System requirements definition process (ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015, 6.4.3) or System/software requirements definition process (ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017, 6.4.3)

**Problem**: Standards are (deliberately) vague and hard to apply to a specific problem.
