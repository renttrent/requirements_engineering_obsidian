Agile development procedure skeptical about number and level of detail of artifacts beyond code and tests: **no immediate customer value**; hard to maintain over time (will discuss agility later). 
Plus, documents often come as planning documents (!). And what if requirements change?

Artifacts need to be **synchronised** with each other.

Change of context/requirement: **cost of changing artifacts**.

**"Quality" of artifacts in general hard/impossible to assess!** This is the reason for standardized processes: ISO26262 functional safety; Common Criteria for security; ISO 9000 for quality in general. Require existence of processes and certain artifacts but do not state their quality.

However, ***maintenance is difficult without well-documented requirements***!
