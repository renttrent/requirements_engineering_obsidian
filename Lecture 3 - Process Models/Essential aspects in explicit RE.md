Are **roles** ('responsibilities') clearly defined?
Is the **engineering procedure** clearly defined?
- Are requirements explicitly developed and documented?
- Are requirements validated?
- Is the quality of the requirements checked?
- Is the correct implementation of the requirements systematically monitored?
- Is there an updated description of the implemented requirements at the end of the project?

In other words: What is the [[Engineering Model]] used in this project?
