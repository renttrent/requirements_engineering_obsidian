### Problem
- Capture stakeholders and their goals
- Understand describe the problem
- Specify and validate characteristics and capabilities of potential solutions

### Solution
- Iteratively derive a specification of a solution, that solves the problem
- Develop function and architecture models
- Establish tracking and verification
- Incorporate changes

***The distinction between problem definition and solution is essential in RE!*** 
***Engineers are trained to focus on the solution!!!***

#### Separating Problem and Solutions is not trivial

Common examples for solution orientation:
- 'Goal of the project is to build an app that...'
- 'Where can I rent a car to drive to supermarket for groceries?'
- 'To avoid that our server crashes when all students submit their homework five minutes before the deadline, we will need a more powerful server.'

*In contrast - Design Thinking is about understanding the problem first*


#### Whats wrong with premature solution orientation?

Requirements are often not explicitly identified, but it is rushed to a solution.

- Essential requirements are **not considered**.
- Solution space is unnecessarily **restricted**.
- Decisions are **not validated** with stakeholders
- System has properties, which are **not required** ('Gold Plating') and do not add immediate value ('wouldn't it be cool to have this feature as well?')
