**Modelling of Use Cases**
- Structured Text
- Models (Activity Diagrams, Message Sequence Charts)

**Core Components**
Context of use (remember design thinking: 'user journey' extends this idea)
- Primary actors and their goals
- Precondition: Assumptions about system environment and the initial situation
- Postcondition: Utilisation goal and target situation
- Scenarios: Work steps and required interaction between actors (users, neighbouring systems) and system
	- Control Flow
	- Scenarios
