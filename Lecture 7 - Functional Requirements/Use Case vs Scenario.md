- A use case is a set of scenarios
- A scenario is an ordered set (sequence) of interactions (functional requirements)
- Use cases can be described with the [[Use Case Template of Cockburn]]
- The interactions in a scenario can be unfolded into smaller and smaller interactions (eg, buy coke, put coin in machine)
- Some scenarios end with success, some end with failure


A Use Case is a state and property-oriented structuring of the system behaviour which
1. has purpose and context (business processes)
2. collects several scenarios

Use Cases summarise a number of scenarios for a targeted system of usage
- Use Case:
	Task, objective, performance for the "users", task structuring, causal dependencies (also pre- and post- conditions)
- Scenario:
	Sequence of events (work steps, events, interactions)

Functional Requirement
A 'system' response to a stimulus
