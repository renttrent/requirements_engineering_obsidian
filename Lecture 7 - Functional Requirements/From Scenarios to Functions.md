1. **Identify system functions** based on the use cases / scenarios (context of use with assumptions, preliminary and post conditions, triggers, ...) 
2. **Refine** and **structure system functions** using a hierarchy 
3. **Identify dependencies** between the functions 
4. **Define external interfaces** (Dialogs, Data, ...)

#### Function Hierarchies allow smooth transition into the design
- Definition of a logical component architecture
- Specification of **interface** behaviour by means of automata
- Iterative data modelling (continuous completion)
