#### A good User Story is:
- **Independent**: No dependencies between stories as they lead to planning problems 
- **Negotiable**: User Stories are no requirements, but description of functionality to be negotiated
- **Valuable**: User Stories should be valuable to users or customers
- **Estimable**: Developers should be able to estimate the size of a story
- **Small**: Long stories are difficult to understand and should be split up in a series of smaller stories
- **Testable**: Stories must be written so as to be testable. Passing all tests proves deployment


**Comparison between User Stories and Use Cases (flaky!):**
- User Stories: Written in users’ everyday language, small scale and easy to use information; more geared towards needs; "atomic"; clear role; "invitation to discuss" 
- Use Cases: Written in users’ business language, organise requirements, list of steps; more geared towards requirements; multiple scenarios; "can be used as basis in a contract
