- Overview of functions for analysing system behaviour
- Functions are
	1. identified on the basis of uses cases
	2. analysed / tuned by means of Use Cases
	3. structured in hierarchies

**Use of Function Hierarchies**:
- Creation of syntactic interfaces: Specification of the amount of inputs and outputs at system interfaces, which serve the realisation of the function
- Specification of the behaviour (models)
- Definition of a logical component architecture
