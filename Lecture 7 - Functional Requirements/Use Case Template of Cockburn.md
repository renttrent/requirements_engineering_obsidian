A scenario is a sequence of goal-achieving actions

The main success scenario is the most common scenario:
- Is a simple/typical story without too much complexity
- Cockburn: Description without Extension or Sub-Variations

The use case collects all the scenarios which are related to the goal of the primary actor:
- The "set of possible sequences" is called a "use case"
- The "sequence of (concrete) interactions" is called a "scenario" in the use cases
- A scenario consists of steps, each step is an action

-> A use case is the collection of possible scenarios
