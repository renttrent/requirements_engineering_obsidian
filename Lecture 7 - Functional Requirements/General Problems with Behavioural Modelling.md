Behavioural modelling does not start with the design! 
- Use of modelling techniques allow seamless transition to the design
- Danger of **solution orientation** (drifting into the draft)
- Multiple facets/languages need to be synchronised

**The tendency is therefore**: Make sure that
- There is focus on the analysis of the intended usage behaviour from the overall system view (black box)
- Use cases and scenarios are used to understand analyse the context and intention of the users
- Function hierarchies can be used
	- to systematically implement a change of perspective from usage scenarios to user-visible functions
	- to systematise an (iterative) transition into the design
