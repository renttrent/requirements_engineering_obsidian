[[Formulation]] and **Representation** of content in a form *independent of individual* *(subjective) interpretation* and based on a given *system of definitions* (theory).

## How to apply Formalization:
- Formal Language
- Semantics
	- Translation into reference systematics (logic, mathematics)
	- Rules for the transformation and deduction of further contents ("statements")
- Metrics

Typically, proven and prepared [[Formalization Concepts]]are used for formalization.

### Formalization provides Precision:

**Natural Language**
- ambiguous, contextual 
- very complex
- informally described requirements are usually not precise and thus not free of subjective interpretation (hence ambiguous)

**Formalization** provides *a more preciese definition*:
- clearly defines the meaning, i.e. one interpretation of the requirement, which is at first only formulated in natural language, is chosen from a set of possible interpretations. (requires validation --- is this specification the desired one?)
- choice of certain formalization concepts: this raises the question of comprehensibility and manageability

However specification of system properties requires a precise definition of "system", or even a formal model for a System. And it requires precisely understood requirements

#### Formalization and Quality Requirements of IEEE 830

- **Correct**: better "valid", formulated vs actual requirements (stakeholder expectations), requires precision
- **Unambiguous**: Formalization can help if it is understandable
- **Complete**: Formalization can help to uncover incompleteness
- **Consistent**: Consistency - formal logic consistency
- **Verifiable**: In mathematical sense only with formalization
- **Modifiable**: Change effects through formalization of visible
- **Traceable**: Formalization simplifies requirement relationships
- **Ranked for Importance / Stability**: Does not affect formalisation
