**Definition**:
*External system behaviour*, characterised by *stimulus-response* (input-output) pairs.
(everything else becomes a non-functional requirement)

- Often in the form of "*The system must do xy*"
- Justified by objectives and collected from various sources
- Specify *product features*

**Critical view**:
Definition and *distinction* between functional and non-functional requirements is difficult
- On which levels of abstraction and in which context can functionality be considered?
- How can behaviour systematically be recorded and described in a structured way?
