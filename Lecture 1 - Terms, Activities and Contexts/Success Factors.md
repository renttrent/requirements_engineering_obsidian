Requirements as the linchpin for project success:
- If requirements missing -> value of product reduced
- If unnecessary requirements are realized -> product becomes more expensive
- If requirements change during project -> costly changes and rescheduling are necessary

If product is highly **innovative** RE is particularly important:
- Req usually unclear at the beginning
- Req often unstable and learning curves are expected

**Problem in research** how to quantify exact cost/benefit ration in RE?
